# analyzing-the-emotionality-of-the-text-spanish-
We will analyze the text of a poem and a song to determine the emotionality they evoke using software analysis. After performing the analysis, we will compare whether these positive or negative sentiments align with what we truly understand or what the analyzed texts intend to convey.

This type of analysis can also be performed on interviews, speeches, podcasts, mailing lists, etc., always bearing in mind that there is a considerable margin of error, as non-verbal communication is also highly significant, and elements like irony cannot be efficiently measured in plain text.
